Fleet Management Web Application

This is a WampServer project, so in order to use it, you need to put the root directory in the 'www' directory of Wamp, and import the bdsona.sql in PhpMyAdmin with username:root without password.

There are 3 types of users:

1) Administrator (The fleet manager): username: admin@admin.com, password:admin.

2) Supervisor (Accepts or refuses the employees car demands): username: super@super.com, password: super.

3) Employee: username: user@user.com, password: user.

Enjoy !
